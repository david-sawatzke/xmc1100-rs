# xmc1100 device crate

Currently using the unpatched original svd file "CMSIS PACK XMC1000 (Version
V2.7.0)". This is under a proprietary library. As the resulting crate is only
using the information from the svd file, I believe it to not fall under this
license (but this is not legal advice, I'm not in any way, shape or form a lawyer).
